It should execute the callback fn 1x per array.length.  
It should return the first element of the array that passes the cbfn test.
It should return undefined if no elements of the array that pass the cbfn test.
It should return the value of that first truthy test that passes.
It should visit every index of the array, including blanks.
It should use the this value in each callback fn iteration if a this arg is provided.
It should use undefined if no this value is provided.
It should not mutuate the original array.
It should allow the array to be mutated by the cbfn before the first call of the cbfn.
It should not visit any elems added to the array after the call to find begins.
It should use the value of an elem which existed when find visited that elem.
It should visit deleted elements even if deleted by the cbfn.
